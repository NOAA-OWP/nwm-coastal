#### NOAA-OWP Coastal Processing Tools

`nwm-coastal` is a collection of tools designed to implement skill assessments for coastal model runs and execute National Water Model (NWM) hindcast/forecast runs for standalone coastal models utilized in NWMv4 operations. This includes the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM) and Super-Fast INudation of CoastS (SFINCS) as the intended coastal models for implementation in NWMv4 operations. This repository stores symlinks to both coastal modeling development groups, which are used to compile and run the NWMv4 coastal models. The coastal modeling output for NWMv4 operations is the Total Water Level (TWL) fields. These fields are the focus of the coastal tools in this repository for skill assessments across NWM domains, as well as the end result to retrieve from tools in this repository that set up and execute NWMv4 hindcast and operational forecast runs.
