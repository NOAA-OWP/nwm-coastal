# # Pre-Delivery Walkthrough: SCHISM + SFINCS over the Mendocino Coast
#
# End-to-end demo of the `coastal_calibration` library and `nwm_coastal`
# QGIS plugin against a single Pacific coastal subdomain (Mendocino /
# Point Arena, CA). The walkthrough covers:
#
# 1. **Draw the SCHISM subset polygon** in QGIS with the plugin's
#    Draw Polygon tool, then save it as `extract_poly.geojson`.
# 2. **Extract** a sub-mesh from the full Pacific SCHISM domain using
#    that polygon, then run the SCHISM pipeline on the subdomain.
# 3. **Derive the SFINCS inputs** in QGIS: turn the extracted SCHISM
#    mesh boundary into an SFINCS AOI polygon and pick the NWM
#    flowlines that enter the domain.
# 4. **Build & run** the SFINCS model on the same boundary.
# 5. **Compare** modeled water levels against a NOAA CO-OPS tide gauge
#    in a single 3-line plot (Observed, SCHISM, SFINCS).
# 6. **Animate** SCHISM and SFINCS water-level fields side-by-side with
#    a shared colorbar.
#
# Both simulations are 50 hours long and run locally in roughly 4 minutes
# each on this machine; no HPC is required.

# ## 0. Setup
#
# The walkthrough runs out of `docs/examples/walkthrough/`. That
# directory is committed with the four input GeoJSONs the demo needs
# (`extract_poly.geojson`, `aoi.geojson`, `refine_poly.geojson`,
# `discharge_nwm.geojson`). Sections 1 and 3 below document the QGIS
# steps that produce these files. The full Pacific SCHISM mesh and
# the WRF geogrid are not redistributable, so they live as symlinks
# (`model`, `geo_em_CONUS.nc`) pointing at the proprietary data drive
# (see `docs/examples/README.md` for how to set them up).

# ## 1. QGIS plugin: draw the SCHISM subset polygon
#
# The walkthrough starts in QGIS, where the `nwm_coastal` plugin turns
# the full Pacific SCHISM mesh into a coastal subset polygon. The
# output of this section is `extract_poly.geojson`, the first input
# that the SCHISM pipeline in Section 2 consumes.
#
# **The walkthrough has this file pre-staged** in
# `docs/examples/walkthrough/extract_poly.geojson`, so the SCHISM
# section below runs without QGIS. The steps below document how it
# was produced.
#
# ### Step 1: Install the plugin and view the toolbar
#
# After installing the plugin, restart QGIS. The `nwm_coastal` toolbar
# appears as the highlighted row of icons below, with one icon per
# pipeline step in left-to-right order.
#
# ![nwm_coastal toolbar in QGIS](../images/plugin_window.png)
#
# ### Step 2: Add the NHF basemap
#
# Click **Add Basemap** (first plugin icon). Point the dialog at the
# National HydroFabric `.gpkg` (or `.gdb`) for this region. Tick the
# layers you need (Divides, Flowpaths, Gages, Nexus) and check
# **Include CO-OPS stations** to also auto-download nearby NOAA tide
# gauges. An optional *Flowpaths Override* lets you swap in an
# alternate flowpaths source without re-staging the whole NHF dataset.
#
# ![Add Basemap dialog](../images/plugin_basemap.png)
#
# The plugin loads each layer with default styling: flowpaths in blue,
# divides in light yellow, gages and nexus as point layers, CO-OPS
# gauges as orange stars, over an OpenStreetMap base.
#
# ![Basemap loaded](../images/plugin_basemap_loaded.png)
#
# ### Step 3: Load the Pacific SCHISM mesh
#
# Click **Load SCHISM Mesh** and select the full Pacific mesh
# `hgrid.gr3`. The plugin streams the mesh into QGIS as the `hgrid`
# triangular mesh layer over the NHF basemap.
#
# ![Pacific SCHISM mesh loaded over basemap](../images/plugin_load_schism.png)
#
# ### Step 4: Draw and save the subset polygon
#
# Zoom into the coastal area of interest (here, the Mendocino /
# Point Arena coast). Click **Draw Polygon** from the plugin toolbar,
# then click on the map to place vertices that bound the subset, and
# double-click to finish the polygon. With the new polygon layer
# selected, click **Save Polygon** from the plugin to write
# `extract_poly.geojson` into the walkthrough directory (WGS84). The
# SCHISM pipeline in the next section reads this file directly.
#
# ![Draw Polygon over the Pacific SCHISM mesh](../images/plugin_extract_schism.png)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2. Extract a SCHISM subdomain
#
# `extract_mesh` keeps the portion of the full Pacific SCHISM mesh that
# falls inside the polygon and rebuilds the open boundaries where the
# polygon edge crosses the mesh. The result is a small, self-contained
# project under `extracted/` ready for the pipeline runner.

# ### Run the SCHISM pipeline
#
# The runner executes the 12 stages: download, sflux, atmospheric
# regridding, boundary conditions, NWM discharge, mesh partitioning,
# SCHISM execution, and post-processing (station comparison + obs-points
# extraction). On this machine the full 50-hour simulation completes in

# ## 3. QGIS plugin: derive the SFINCS AOI and discharge flowlines
#
# With the SCHISM subset built and run, return to QGIS to produce the
# two SFINCS-side inputs:
#
# 1. **`aoi.geojson`**: a polygon that aligns the seaward edge of the
#    SFINCS domain with the SCHISM mesh boundary and snaps the landward
#    edge to NHF watershed divides.
# 2. **`discharge_nwm.geojson`**: the NWM flowlines that cross the AOI
#    boundary, keyed by an integer NWM feature ID (column name passed
#    to the SFINCS create stage as `nwm_id_column`; the create stage
#    normalizes it to `"name"` internally so the run stage can look up
#    NWM streamflow regardless of the source column name).
#
# **The walkthrough has both files pre-staged** in
# `docs/examples/walkthrough/`, so Sections 4-6 are runnable today.
# The steps below document how those files were produced.
#
# ### Step 1: Clear the map
#
# The QGIS session from Section 1 still has the full Pacific SCHISM
# mesh and other intermediate layers loaded. Click **Clear Map** from
# the plugin to drop the SCHISM-related layers and leave only the NHF
# basemap behind, giving a clean slate for the SFINCS-side work.
#
# ![Clear Map button on the plugin toolbar](../images/plugin_clear.png)
#
# ### Step 2: Load the subset SCHISM mesh
#
# Click **Load SCHISM Mesh** and select `extracted/hgrid.gr3` from
# this walkthrough directory. The plugin loads the subset mesh as the
# `hgrid` triangular mesh layer over the NHF basemap.
#
# ### Step 3: Extract the mesh boundary and load NWM reaches
#
# Click **Extract Mesh Boundary**. The plugin parses the open,
# exterior, and island boundaries from `hgrid.gr3` and adds a
# `mesh_boundary` polygon layer that traces the SCHISM domain edge
# exactly. This polygon is the seaward seed for the SFINCS AOI.
#
# Then click **Load NWM Reaches** from the plugin. This adds the sink
# and source points of the subset SCHISM model as a visual guide for
# which NWM reaches enter and leave the domain, helping you pick the
# right flowpaths in Step 6 below.
#
# ![Mesh boundary polygon and NWM sink/source points over the SCHISM mesh](../images/plugin_schism_mesh.png)
#
# ### Step 4: Union the boundary with NHF divides and save the AOI
#
# In the QGIS Layers panel, select the `mesh_boundary` layer. Use the
# QGIS **Select Features** tool to click on and select the polygon on
# the map. With the polygon selected, click **NHF Union** from the
# plugin. The plugin extends the boundary inland to fully include
# every NHF watershed divide it clips, producing a `merged_polygon`
# layer. This is what makes the SFINCS domain hydrologically
# meaningful: every river entering the domain has its full upstream
# catchment inside the AOI, so NWM discharge sources line up with
# watershed boundaries. With the `merged_polygon` layer selected and
# its polygon selected on the map, click **Save Polygon** from the
# plugin to write `aoi.geojson` (WGS84) into the walkthrough directory.
#
# ![merged_polygon: SCHISM boundary unioned with NHF divides](../images/plugin_divide_union.png)
#
# ### Step 5: Select and export discharge flowpaths
#
# Select the `flowpaths` layer in the Layers panel. With the QGIS
# **Select Features** tool, select every river that crosses the AOI
# boundary (the NWM sink/source points loaded in Step 3 show you
# which ones enter or exit the domain). Once the right flowpaths are
# selected, click **Export Selected Flowpaths** from the plugin and
# save as `discharge_nwm.geojson`. The file keeps the source NHF
# integer ID column (`ID` for the demo dataset), which is what the
# SFINCS create stage uses to map flowlines back to NWM streamflow.
#
# ![Selected discharge flowpaths inside the AOI](../images/plugin_discharge_flowpath.png)
#
# The setup cell at the top of this notebook expects
# `extract_poly.geojson`, `aoi.geojson`, and `discharge_nwm.geojson`
# to live in `docs/examples/walkthrough/`. All three are committed
# alongside the notebook so this section can be skipped end-to-end on
# a re-run. To use a different domain, regenerate them with the steps
# above and drop them into the walkthrough directory under the same
# names.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 4. Build & run the SFINCS model
#
# `SfincsCreateConfig.from_dict` bundles every input the model needs:
# the AOI polygon, a base 512 m quadtree grid with one refinement level
# inside the AOI, NOAA CRM 3 arc-second (~90 m) topobathy + GEBCO
# elevation, ESA WorldCover-derived Manning's *n*, and the QGIS-derived
# flowlines as discharge sources.  CRM is a public, integrated
# topobathy product from NCEI THREDDS, and it resolves coastal bays
# that the land-only Copernicus DEM misses.
# `add_noaa_gages: True` also auto-discovers the same NOAA tide gauge
# the SCHISM pipeline uses, which is what makes the 3-line comparison
# in Part 4 work without any manual station bookkeeping.

# ## 6. Side-by-side spatial animation
#
# `animate_water_level_comparison` renders two panels driven by their
# own datasets but locked to a shared colormap range and synchronised
# on a common time clock. The two models output at different cadences
# (SCHISM hourly, SFINCS half-hourly), so the function takes the
# intersection of their time coverage, picks the coarser axis as the
# master clock, and uses nearest-neighbour lookup to populate the
# other panel each frame.
#
# ### A note on the river channels

# Both models show water at the upstream NWM inflow points but not
# along the river course down to the ocean. This is not a bug; it is
# a property of the **NOAA CRM topobathy DEM**: at 3 arc-second
# (~90 m) the CRM resolves the seaward bathymetry of the bay but is
# still too coarse to carve narrow river channels into the inland part
# of the grid. The model bed along the rivers therefore sits at the
# surrounding land elevation (tens of meters above MSL), so river
# discharge from `nwm_reaches.geojson` deposits water on a "high" bed:
# a small puddle forms at the inflow point but cannot flow downhill
# over a bed that is already above the water surface.
#
# Tightening the visualization's wet-cell threshold from 0.05 m to
# 0.0 m exposes the thin film of water that does propagate, but the
# rest of the river course genuinely has `h ≤ 0` in the model output.
# A proper fix needs a hydro-conditioned DEM (rivers burned into the
# topobathy), which is intentionally **out of scope** for this demo.

# ## Summary
#
# The walkthrough exercised the full client-facing surface of the
# library plus the QGIS plugin:
#
# - **QGIS plugin (extract polygon)**: *Add Basemap*, *Load SCHISM
#   Mesh*, *Draw Polygon*, and *Save Polygon* produced
#   `extract_poly.geojson` from the full Pacific mesh.
# - **Subdomain extraction**: `extract_mesh` carved a Mendocino
#   subdomain from the 3.1 M-node Pacific mesh in seconds.
# - **Unified pipeline runner**: the same `CoastalCalibRunner` ran a
#   12-stage SCHISM job and, with a different config, a 14-stage
#   SFINCS job on the matching domain.
# - **QGIS plugin (SFINCS inputs)**: *Clear Map*, *Load SCHISM Mesh*,
#   *Extract Mesh Boundary*, *NHF Union*, *Save Polygon*, *Load NWM
#   Reaches*, and *Export Selected Flowpaths* chained the SCHISM mesh
#   boundary into a hydrologically meaningful SFINCS AOI and a
#   discharge-flowline geojson.
# - **3-line comparison**: `plot_station_comparison` overlaid
#   Observed, SCHISM, and SFINCS series at the shared CO-OPS gauge.
# - **Side-by-side animation**: `animate_water_level_comparison`
#   rendered the two model fields with a single shared colorbar,
#   handling the two different output cadences automatically.
